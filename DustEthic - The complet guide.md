## üéØ Core principle

**Think in crypto, not in fiat.**  
Amounts are counted in the native units of the chain. Example: you donate 0.0100 ETH, the NGO receives 0.0090 ETH if the publicly declared commission is 10%. This **neutralizes volatility in the split** among actors. **Fiat value still fluctuates** until each party converts.  
In this guide, fiat is only used to aid understanding.

### üîå Gas policy v0.1 - default

- **L2-first**: operate primarily on low-fee L2s (for example Optimism, Arbitrum) so gas is marginal.  
- **Relayer gas pool**: the relayer maintains a pool of the chain‚Äôs gas token (for example ETH on EVM L2). **No donor funds are converted to finance the relayer‚Äôs commission.**  
- **Optional safety net**: if the gas pool runs short, a **minimal, on-chain documented conversion** can be triggered to acquire gas token, without changing the standard split formula.  
- **Standard display**:  
  - Formula: `NGO net = Gross amount - gas - network fees - commission`  
  - Commission shown **as a percentage of the donated crypto** (for example 7% in ETH when the donation is in ETH)  
- **Transparency**: the chosen gas option (gas pool, L2-first, safety net) is **declared publicly** by each relayer.

## 1) The real problem today

- On Ethereum L1, **gas is paid in ETH** and may exceed small donations. On L2, fees are much lower, but not zero.  
- Several EVM L2s also use **ETH as gas** (for example Arbitrum, Optimism). Polygon PoS uses **POL** since the MATIC to POL migration.  
- Result: a single micro-donation is often inefficient on L1, sometimes acceptable on L2, and depends on current network conditions.

---

## 2) DustEthic‚Äôs proposed solution

**Aggregation + on-chain transparency + splitting in crypto units**:

- **Relayers** aggregate micro-donations during a limited window, then execute **one grouped transfer** to the NGO.  
- NGO share, network fees and relayer commission are **calculated as a percentage of the donated crypto**, not a fiat equivalent.  
- Transparency via public explorers (for example Etherscan on Ethereum).

**Existing technical building blocks**:

- **Account Abstraction ERC-4337** with **paymasters** to sponsor user gas.  
- **EIP-2612 permit** where available, enabling approval by signature without an on-chain approve transaction.

---

## 3) Realistic operational flow

**Step 1 - Donation**  
- Smart account with AA and paymaster: **gas is sponsored**, donor does not pay directly.  
- EOA + token with permit: **approval without gas**, then relayed donation.  
- EOA + token without permit: an **on-chain approval** may be required, depending on the token.

**Step 2 - Aggregation**  
- Donations are collected in an aggregation smart contract. Recommended triggers: amount threshold, max time window, acceptable gas window.

**Step 3 - Grouped transfer**  
- A single transaction sends funds to the NGO.  
- Standard formula:  
  - `NGO net = Gross amount - gas - network fees - commission`

**Step 4 - Public reporting**  
- Donations, any minimal conversions and the final payout are visible on the chain explorer.

---

## 4) Gas, conversions and design options

**Physical constraints**: on EVM, gas is paid in the chain‚Äôs **native token**. Examples: ETH on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum. **POL** on Polygon PoS.  
To uphold the principle ‚Äúno conversion for the commission‚Äù, DustEthic v0.1 proposes explicit options for gas funding:

- **Option A - Relayer gas pool**: relayer keeps the required gas token. No conversion on donor funds.  
- **Option B - Minimal documented conversion**: pro-rata skim to buy gas token, logged on-chain, and not changing the split beyond the gas cost.  
- **Option C - L2-first**: operate primarily on low-fee L2s so gas is marginal.  
- **Option D - Sponsored paymasters**: partners preload the gas pool and are periodically reimbursed.

---

## 5) Volatility - principles and strategies

**Rule**: the split is made in crypto units. Percentages stay constant, fiat value varies until the NGO or relayer converts.

**Stablecoins**: reduce volatility but **do not eliminate risk** (for example depeg, address freeze, issuer risk).

**After receiving**:  
- **NGO**: sell immediately, sell partially, or hold depending on internal policy and risk tolerance.  
- **Relayer**: sell regularly, hold, or mixed approach.

---

## 6) Actors and responsibilities

- **Donors**: send small amounts, ideally via AA to avoid paying gas directly.  
- **Relayers**: operate aggregation, publish public parameters, comply with v0.1 spec and keep a public log for sensitive operations.  
- **NGOs**: receive directly to their wallet, define a conversion policy and minimal compliance procedures.

---

## 7) Donors - how it works

1) Pick a relayer that complies with DustEthic.  
2) Connect your wallet.  
3) Choose the NGO.  
4) Enter the amount in **crypto units**.  
5) Sign. Gasless via AA or permit when available. Otherwise a one-time approval may be needed depending on the token.

**Cost for donors**: ideally zero via AA or permit. Otherwise only the initial approval when required by the token. Gas for the final grouped transfer is **mutualized** and deducted before the NGO payout.

**Tracking**: each donation and the final payout are visible on the chain explorer.

---

## 8) NGOs - integration, accounting, compliance

**Recommended wallet**: **Safe** multi-signature for custody.  
**Fiat conversion**: via a registered exchange, per your internal policy.  
**Accounting**: record value at receipt time, define conversion policy, track addresses.  
**Minimal compliance**: even in non-custodial setups, adopt **basic address screening** and a written policy. References: **OFAC** and **FATF R.15 / Travel Rule**. Exact obligations depend on your jurisdiction and status.

## 9) Relayers - minimum requirements for DustEthic v0.1

**Transparency**  
- Open-source code. Public parameters: commission rate, aggregation windows, supported networks, chosen gas option.  
- Readable on-chain dashboard.

**Non-custodial**  
- Funds held by smart contracts. Technical governance without unilateral withdrawal power.

**Technical governance**  
- Admin roles under **Safe** multi-sig. Timelock for critical changes. Emergency procedures.

**Security**  
- Independent audit before mainnet. Bug bounty after launch.

**Gas and conversions**  
- Explicitly choose Option A, B, C or D and display it publicly.  
- Commission always as a percentage of the donated crypto.  
- If any gas conversion is required, log it on-chain.

**AA and compatibility**  
- ERC-4337 and paymaster support recommended on L2. The published EntryPoint is the reference implementation.

**v1 allowlist of assets**  
- Ethereum and EVM L2: ETH, USDC, USDT.  
- Polygon PoS: viable but **gas in POL** - plan logistics accordingly.  
- By default reject illiquid, taxed, honeypot tokens or those without permit if UX becomes impractical.

**Minimal compliance**  
- Proportionate AML policy, basic screening, logging of refusals.

---

## 10) Market references and positioning

- Crypto donation platforms for **regular size donations** already exist and often convert immediately to fiat.  
  - **Every.org**: instant USD conversion, broker fee about 1% + network fees.  
  - **The Giving Block**: commercial packages and processing fees.  
- **DustEthic** focuses on **micro-donations via aggregation** and **native crypto splits** on low-fee L2s.
